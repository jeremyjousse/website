# Content Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Warm and Narrative:** The writing style should be engaging and personal, focusing on storytelling to share the "why" and "how" behind travel experiences and culinary creations.
- **Approachable but Clear:** While the tone is personal, instructions (recipes or tech tutorials) must remain easy to follow and unambiguous.

## Visual Media
- **High-Quality Imagery:** Visuals are central to the storytelling. Use large, high-resolution images to showcase food, landscapes, and key moments.
- **Alt Text:** Every image must have descriptive alternative text to ensure accessibility for visually impaired users.

## Technical Content
- **Syntax Highlighting:** All code snippets must be clean, well-formatted, and use syntax highlighting for maximum readability.
- **Contextual Explanations:** Code blocks should be accompanied by clear explanations that relate the code back to the problem being solved.

## Accessibility and Performance
- **Semantic Structure:** Content must use proper HTML headings (H1-H6) and lists to maintain a logical document structure.
- **Optimization:** All images should be optimized for the web (WebP/AVIF formats where possible) to ensure the site remains fast and responsive.
